# Experimental Bootstrap Landing Page

## What is This Project About?

This is a landing page for a non-existent/sample company. I made this when I was first learning Bootstrap.

HTML and Bootstrap.

## Purposes of the Project

I was learning Bootstrap through official documentation and online tutorials and I wanted to experiment and get familiar with the syntax and the flow of code when making responsive websites for different devices simultaneously.
